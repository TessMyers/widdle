I hate fun so I wrote a script that ruins wordle. 

This script can be used to find a set of five words that cover nearly all letters of the alphabet, so if you use these 5 words in your first 5 wordle guesses you'll have a pretty easy time figuring out the answer due to process of elimination. Throw an anagram solver in there and you basically don't have to use your brain at all!

There is likely more than one set of 5 words that cover nearly all 26 letters of the alphabet. Possibly even a holy grail that gets all 25 with no repeats. I wouldn't know because I exceeded maximum call stack size before getting there. Below is one set, hidden behind a spoiler wall. Don't blame me if this ruins wordle for you.

abets
flick
grown
jumpy
vozhd (not even english, but apparently it's a scrabble word)

Q and X will be your only letters that haven't been ruled in or out, so your final guess should be fairly straightforward.

uhh, working on improving this bit
